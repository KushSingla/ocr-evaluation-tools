Introduction
============

The ISRI Analytic Tools consist of 19 tools for meansuring the
performance of and experimenting with OCR output.  See the user guide
(user-guide.pdf) for more information.


Building
========

Each subdirectory contains the source for one program, a Unix man
page, and a build script named "Build".  Most programs depend on
a library that is build by Modules/Build.  To build the library
and all of the programs, cd into each directory and run ./Build.

A more featureful and flexible build procedure will hopefully come in
the future.
