Introduction
============

The ISRI Analytic Tools consist of 19 tools for meansuring the
performance of and experimenting with OCR output.  See the user guide
(user-guide.pdf) for more information.


Building
========

To build the tools, run:

  make

To install them, run:

  make install

To install them to a different directory, run:

  make PREFIX=/my/install/directory install


Running tests with UTF-8
========================

Run the tool inside the ocrtoolutf8 wrapper script, e.g.

   ocrtoolutf8 accuracy correct.txt ocr.txt
or
   ocrtoolutf8 wordacc correct.txt ocr.txt

This is needed as the tools don't (yet) natively handle UTF-8, but
they can handle strangely encoded UTF-16, which this wrapper script
delivers.
